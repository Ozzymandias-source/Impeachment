Dear Official,

We, the undersigned citizens of the Republic of Kenya and the World, exercising our sovereign power under Article 1 of the Constitution 
of Kenya (2010) and the Geneva Conventions, and in pursuit of justice and accountability, hereby submit this motion for the impeachment of President 
William Samoei Ruto, pursuant to Article 145 of the Constitution of Kenya, on grounds of gross violation of the Constitution,commission of serious crimes under national and international law, and gross misconduct rendering him unfit to hold the 
office of the President. We further demand his prosecution locally and at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for 
alleged crimes against humanity and other offenses. 

WHEREAS, the Constitution of Kenya establishes the President as a symbol of national unity, tasked with upholding the rule
of law, protecting the rights of all citizens, and ensuring integrity in public office;
WHEREAS, Article 145 of the Constitution provides for the impeachment of the President for gross violation of the Constitution, 
commission of a crime under national or international law, or gross misconduct;
WHEREAS, President William Samoei Ruto has been credibly implicated in actions and omissions that undermine the Constitution, 
erode public trust, and constitute serious offenses against the people of Kenya, as detailed below:

Gross Violation of the Constitution:
Misappropriation of Public Funds: Allegations circulating suggest that President Ruto’s kith and kin have siphoned billions of 
Kenyan shillings from the critical public service platforms for delivering government services. If true, this constitutes a gross 
violation of Article 201 (principles of public finance, including transparency and accountability) and Article 10 (national values, 
including integrity and good governance). While these claims remain unverified, they have fuelled public distrust and demand investigation.

Suppression of Fundamental Rights: The Ruto administration has been linked to systemic violations of Chapter Four (Bill of Rights), 
including the right to life (Article 26), freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (Article 29), and freedoms of 
expression, assembly, and association (Articles 33, 36, and 37). Reports from reputable sources, including BBC and The Washington Post, 
document over 100 deaths during anti-government protests since June 2024, with security forces accused of excessive force, abductions, 
and torture of activists and protesters. These actions indicate a deliberate disregard for constitutional protections.

Promotion of Tribalism and Unconstitutional Appointments: President Ruto’s appointments have been criticized for favouring certain ethnic 
groups, particularly the Kalenjin, over others, violating Article 27 (equality and freedom from discrimination) and Article 232 (values of 
public service, including fair representation). The impeachment of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua in October 2024, widely perceived as 
orchestrated by Ruto, has been accused of fuelling tribal tensions, exacerbating ethnic divisions.

Violation of Secular State Principles: The President’s proposal to construct a church on State House grounds, reported in public discourse, 
raises concerns about breaching Article 8, which establishes Kenya as a secular state, and risks promoting religious favouritism.

Subversion of Judicial Authority: President Ruto has demonstrated a pattern of disregard for judicial rulings and the independence of the judiciary.
Following a High Court ruling that declared his victim compensation panel unconstitutional, he merely restructured it into an advisory body,
a move seen as an attempt to circumvent the court's decision and undermine the mandate of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).
This defiance continues a troubling trend, where Ruto has vowed to proceed with government projects despite adverse court rulings, leading to 
an unprecedented rift and confrontation with the judiciary. The Supreme Court's indefinite barring of a prominent pro-government lawyer for 
scandalizing the court, and his subsequent defiant response, further illustrates the administration's contempt for judicial authority.

Unconstitutional Privatization and Erosion of Sovereignty: President Ruto's plan to privatize 65% of the Kenya Pipeline Corporation (KPC) 
via an Initial Public Offering has been legally challenged on constitutional grounds. A petition filed in January 2026 argues the process 
undermines national sovereignty by being driven by external pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a conditionality for loans, 
violating key principles of public finance and governance. The petition also contends the privatization lacks the required public participation, 
directly contravening constitutional dictates.


Commission of Crimes Under National and International Law:
Corruption and Economic Crimes: Allegations of the eCitizen scandal, if substantiated, would constitute theft, abuse of office, and potentially 
money laundering under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003, and the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2009. 
Past allegations of corruption, including a 2004 case involving fraudulent land deals with the Kenya Pipeline Company and a 2013 court order 
to surrender illegally acquired land, further underscore a pattern of economic misconduct.

Crimes Against Humanity: The Ruto administration’s response to protests, including alleged abductions, torture, and extrajudicial killings, 
mirrors patterns of violence previously investigated by the ICC in the 2007–2008 post-election violence, where Ruto was charged (though acquitted 
in 2016 due to witness interference). The current wave of violence, with over 100 deaths and reports of state-sponsored abductions, may constitute 
crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the ICC, including murder, torture, and persecution. These acts warrant renewed ICC investigation.

Alleged Support for International Terrorists and Rogue Regimes: Unverified claims suggest President Ruto’s administration may have ties to international 
terrorists and rogue illegitimate regimes. While no credible evidence substantiates these allegations, they have amplified public concern and necessitate 
thorough investigation to clear or confirm the President’s involvement. Any proven support for terrorism would violate the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2012, 
and international law, including UN Security Council Resolution 1373.

Tribal Violence: The 2007–2008 post-election violence, in which Ruto was accused of orchestrating attacks against Kikuyu communities, resulted in over 
1,200 deaths and 600,000 displacements. Although the ICC case was terminated due to witness intimidation, the lack of accountability has left lingering tensions. 
Recent accusations of fuelling tribal discord through reckless political rhetoric and maneuvering, such as funding of militias in certain regions to quell dissent, sponsoring of  the looting 
and destruction of property of certain individuals from profiled regions risk reigniting ethnic violence, violating Article 27 and international obligations to prevent ethnic persecution.

Politicization of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP):The ODPP has been systematically converted into a political weapon to shield allies 
and persecute critics. High-profile corruption cases against Ruto's allies, including Henry Rotich, Wycliffe Oparanya, and Aisha Jumwa, have been dropped since 
he took office. Conversely, ordinary Kenyans exercising their right to protest have faced trumped-up charges, demonstrating a clear abuse of prosecutorial 
power for political ends. This selective justice constitutes a perversion of the rule of law.

Escalating Grand Corruption: The regime has been engulfed by new, staggering grand corruption scandals. These include the reported loss of Sh6.6 billion
in edible oil imports, Sh3.7 billion in an irregular malaria nets procurement at KEMSA, and Sh3.5 billion through a fake fertilizer programme. 
These massive losses of public funds, alongside ongoing scandals involving entities like the National Youth Service and Kenya Pipeline Company, 
point to a deeply entrenched culture of theft and impunity at the highest levels of government.



Gross Misconduct:
Authoritarian Governance and Protest Suppression: President Ruto’s administration has been accused of authoritarianism, with security forces using anti-terror laws to suppress peaceful protests, as reported by BBC. The dismissal of his entire cabinet in July 2024, followed by the inclusion of opposition members, has been criticized as a political ploy to 
consolidate power rather than address governance failures.

Betrayal of Public Trust: Ruto’s campaign promises of economic upliftment for the “hustler nation” have been overshadowed by unpopular tax hikes and perceived extravagance, 
earning him nicknames like “Zakayo” (tax collector) and “mwizi” (thief). The collapse of a proposed $2 billion Adani Group deal to control Kenya’s main airport, following public outcry, further highlights his administration’s lack of transparency.

Intolerance of Dissent: Reports of abductions targeting critics, including bloggers and activists, and the violent crackdown on protests indicate an intolerance of dissent, undermining 
Article 33 (freedom of expression). The government’s failure to hold police accountable for protester deaths fuels public outrage and distrust.

Systematic Betrayal of Public Trust and "Culture of Lies": President Ruto's tenure is marked by a profound collapse in public trust, stemming from a 
"culture of lies" and broken promises. His aggressive tax hikes, which betray his campaign pledges to support the "hustler nation," have fueled 
widespread discontent and protests, with thousands marching to mark the anniversary of the GenZ anti-tax movement. His administration is characterized by 
stalled projects and repeated "launches" of initiatives, some of which were completed by his predecessor, creating a perception of a government built on deception.
This performance has led Kenya's Catholic bishops to declare that "the truth does not exist" beyond what the government proclaims.

Hypocrisy in the Fight Against Corruption: President Ruto's recent public vows to jail bribe-taking MPs are widely seen as a hollow political gesture that
undermines his credibility. Analysts note that his decision to drop corruption cases against his allies upon taking power in 2022 was a "red flag" signalling 
his lack of seriousness in fighting graft. Furthermore, allegations by his former Deputy President that Ruto bribed MPs with KSh500,000 each and senators with 
KSh10 million to support an impeachment motion in 2024 further devastate his moral authority to lead any anti-corruption drive. This hypocrisy extends to 
accusations from within his own party that he "dumps" allies after using them to consolidate power.

Authoritarian Disregard for Dissent: Ruto's response to growing public discontent has been increasingly authoritarian. He has warned that if there is 
"no Kenya for him, that also would be the case for others," a statement interpreted as a threat to the nation's stability in the face of opposition. 
This rhetoric, combined with the ongoing use of state machinery to suppress protest and the persecution of critics, underscores an intolerance for dissent 
and a dangerous willingness to jeopardize national unity to maintain power.


WHEREAS, these actions demonstrate that President William Samoei Ruto has failed to uphold the dignity and responsibilities of the Office of the President, has breached the Constitution, and has engaged in conduct that endangers the lives, rights, and welfare of Kenyans;
WHEREAS, the citizens of Kenya demand accountability for alleged crimes, both locally through Kenyan courts and internationally at the ICC, to ensure justice for victims of violence, 
corruption, and human rights abuses;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that we, the undersigned citizens of Kenya and the World, call for the following actions:

Impeachment Process:
Initiation: We urge any member of the National Assembly to move a motion for impeachment under Article 145(1), citing gross violation of the Constitution, commission of crimes, and gross misconduct.

Investigation: We demand the formation of a special committee under Article 145(3) to investigate all allegations, including the Adani/eCitizen scandal, abductions, torture, killings, tribalism, and claims of terrorist support. The committee must conduct transparent hearings with civil society and independent experts.

Parliamentary Vote: We call for a vote in the National Assembly requiring at least two-thirds of its 349 members (233 members) and in the Senate requiring at least two-thirds of its 67 members (45 members) to uphold the charges, as per Article 145(6) and (7).

Judicial Oversight: The Judiciary must uphold its independence under Article 160 to ensure a fair process.

Local Prosecution:
We demand that Kenyan authorities, including the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, investigate and prosecute President Ruto and implicated associates for corruption, abuse of office, and human rights violations under relevant Kenyan laws, including the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003, and the Penal Code.

International Prosecution:
We call upon the ICC to reopen investigations into President Ruto’s role in alleged crimes against humanity, including the 2007–2008 post-election violence and recent protest-related violence. The ICC’s 2016 termination of Ruto’s case noted the possibility of future prosecution if new evidence emerges. The current allegations of abductions, torture, and killings warrant such action.
We urge the ICC to investigate unverified claims of support for international terrorists and rogue regimes, ensuring compliance with the Rome Statute.

Citizen Participation: We demand public participation in the impeachment and investigative processes, as mandated by Article 118, through public hearings and submissions to amplify the voices of Kenyans.

Interim Governance: Should the impeachment succeed, we call for the Deputy President or, in their absence, the Speaker of the National Assembly, to assume the office of the President under Article 146, pending a new presidential election within 60 days.

WE, THE CITIZENS OF KENYA and THE WORLD, affix our signatures to this motion as a testament to our commitment to Justice, Accountability, and the Rule of Law. We stand united in defence of the Constitution and the future of the Kenyan nation, demanding the immediate removal of President William Samoei Ruto from office and his prosecution locally and internationally for all alleged civil and criminal offenses.

Signed, 
	
      Signature                
…………………………………………………………………

Concerned Citizens everywhere.




This motion is grounded in the Constitution of Kenya (2010), particularly Article 145, which outlines the impeachment process; Chapter Four, which guarantees fundamental rights and the Geneva Conventions.
For Freedom and Justice Everywhere.
