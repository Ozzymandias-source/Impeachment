Dear Official,

We, the undersigned citizens of the Republic of Kenya and friendy countries, exercising our sovereign power under Article 1 of the Constitution 
of Kenya (2010) and the Geneva Conventions, and in pursuit of justice and accountability, hereby submit this motion for the impeachment of President 
William Samoei Ruto, pursuant to Article 145 of the Constitution, on grounds of gross violation of the Constitution, 
commission of serious crimes under national and international law, and gross misconduct rendering him unfit to hold the 
office of the President. We further demand his prosecution locally and at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for 
alleged crimes against humanity and other offenses. 

WHEREAS, the Constitution of Kenya establishes the President as a symbol of national unity, tasked with upholding the rule
of law, protecting the rights of all citizens, and ensuring integrity in public office;
WHEREAS, Article 145 of the Constitution provides for the impeachment of the President for gross violation of the Constitution, 
commission of a crime under national or international law, or gross misconduct;
WHEREAS, President William Samoei Ruto has been credibly implicated in actions and omissions that undermine the Constitution, 
erode public trust, and constitute serious offenses against the people of Kenya, as detailed below:

Gross Violation of the Constitution:
Misappropriation of Public Funds: Allegations circulating suggest that President Ruto’s kith and kin have siphoned billions of 
Kenyan shillings from the critical public service platforms for delivering government services. If true, this constitutes a gross 
violation of Article 201 (principles of public finance, including transparency and accountability) and Article 10 (national values, 
including integrity and good governance). While these claims remain unverified, they have fuelled public distrust and demand investigation.

Suppression of Fundamental Rights: The Ruto administration has been linked to systemic violations of Chapter Four (Bill of Rights), 
including the right to life (Article 26), freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (Article 29), and freedoms of 
expression, assembly, and association (Articles 33, 36, and 37). Reports from reputable sources, including BBC and The Washington Post, 
document over 100 deaths during anti-government protests since June 2024, with security forces accused of excessive force, abductions, 
and torture of activists and protesters. These actions indicate a deliberate disregard for constitutional protections.

Promotion of Tribalism and Unconstitutional Appointments: President Ruto’s appointments have been criticized for favouring certain ethnic 
groups, particularly the Kalenjin, over others, violating Article 27 (equality and freedom from discrimination) and Article 232 (values of 
public service, including fair representation). The impeachment of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua in October 2024, widely perceived as 
orchestrated by Ruto, has been accused of fuelling tribal tensions, exacerbating ethnic divisions.

Violation of Secular State Principles: The President’s proposal to construct a church on State House grounds, reported in public discourse, 
raises concerns about breaching Article 8, which establishes Kenya as a secular state, and risks promoting religious favouritism.

Commission of Crimes Under National and International Law:
Corruption and Economic Crimes: Allegations of the eCitizen scandal, if substantiated, would constitute theft, abuse of office, and potentially 
money laundering under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003, and the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2009. 
Past allegations of corruption, including a 2004 case involving fraudulent land deals with the Kenya Pipeline Company and a 2013 court order 
to surrender illegally acquired land, further underscore a pattern of economic misconduct.

Crimes Against Humanity: The Ruto administration’s response to protests, including alleged abductions, torture, and extrajudicial killings, 
mirrors patterns of violence previously investigated by the ICC in the 2007–2008 post-election violence, where Ruto was charged (though acquitted 
in 2016 due to witness interference). The current wave of violence, with over 100 deaths and reports of state-sponsored abductions, may constitute 
crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the ICC, including murder, torture, and persecution. These acts warrant renewed ICC investigation.

Alleged Support for International Terrorists and Rogue Regimes: Unverified claims suggest President Ruto’s administration may have ties to international 
terrorists and rogue illegitimate regimes. While no credible evidence substantiates these allegations, they have amplified public concern and necessitate thorough 
investigation to clear or confirm the President’s involvement. Any proven support for terrorism would violate the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2012, 
and international law, including UN Security Council Resolution 1373.

Tribal Violence: The 2007–2008 post-election violence, in which Ruto was accused of orchestrating attacks against Kikuyu communities, resulted in over 
1,200 deaths and 600,000 displacements. Although the ICC case was terminated due to witness intimidation, the lack of accountability has left lingering tensions. 
Recent accusations of fuelling tribal discord through political maneauvers, such as funding of militias in certain regions to quell dissent, sponsoring of  the looting 
and destruction of property of certain individuals from certain regions risk reigniting ethnic violence, violating Article 27 and international obligations to prevent ethnic persecution.




Gross Misconduct:
Authoritarian Governance and Protest Suppression: President Ruto’s administration has been accused of authoritarianism, with security forces using anti-terror laws to suppress peaceful protests, as reported by BBC. The dismissal of his entire cabinet in July 2024, followed by the inclusion of opposition members, has been criticized as a political ploy to 
consolidate power rather than address governance failures.

Betrayal of Public Trust: Ruto’s campaign promises of economic upliftment for the “hustler nation” have been overshadowed by unpopular tax hikes and perceived extravagance, 
earning him nicknames like “Zakayo” (tax collector) and “mwizi” (thief). The collapse of a proposed $2 billion Adani Group deal to control Kenya’s main airport, following public outcry, further highlights his administration’s lack of transparency.

Intolerance of Dissent: Reports of abductions targeting critics, including bloggers and activists, and the violent crackdown on protests indicate an intolerance of dissent, undermining 
Article 33 (freedom of expression). The government’s failure to hold police accountable for protester deaths fuels public outrage and distrust.

WHEREAS, these actions demonstrate that President William Samoei Ruto has failed to uphold the dignity and responsibilities of the Office of the President, has breached the Constitution, and has engaged in conduct that endangers the lives, rights, and welfare of Kenyans;
WHEREAS, the citizens of Kenya demand accountability for alleged crimes, both locally through Kenyan courts and internationally at the ICC, to ensure justice for victims of violence, 
corruption, and human rights abuses;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that we, the undersigned citizens of Kenya, call for the following actions:

Impeachment Process:
Initiation: We urge any member of the National Assembly to move a motion for impeachment under Article 145(1), citing gross violation of the Constitution, commission of crimes, and gross misconduct.

Investigation: We demand the formation of a special committee under Article 145(3) to investigate all allegations, including the Adani/eCitizen scandal, abductions, torture, killings, tribalism, and claims of terrorist support. The committee must conduct transparent hearings with civil society and independent experts.

Parliamentary Vote: We call for a vote in the National Assembly requiring at least two-thirds of its 349 members (233 members) and in the Senate requiring at least two-thirds of its 67 members (45 members) to uphold the charges, as per Article 145(6) and (7).

Judicial Oversight: The Judiciary must uphold its independence under Article 160 to ensure a fair process.

Local Prosecution:
We demand that Kenyan authorities, including the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, investigate and prosecute President Ruto and implicated associates for corruption, abuse of office, and human rights violations under relevant Kenyan laws, including the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003, and the Penal Code.

International Prosecution:
We call upon the ICC to reopen investigations into President Ruto’s role in alleged crimes against humanity, including the 2007–2008 post-election violence and recent protest-related violence. The ICC’s 2016 termination of Ruto’s case noted the possibility of future prosecution if new evidence emerges. The current allegations of abductions, torture, and killings warrant such action.
We urge the ICC to investigate unverified claims of support for international terrorists and rogue regimes, ensuring compliance with the Rome Statute.

Citizen Participation: We demand public participation in the impeachment and investigative processes, as mandated by Article 118, through public hearings and submissions to amplify the voices of Kenyans.

Interim Governance: Should the impeachment succeed, we call for the Deputy President or, in their absence, the Speaker of the National Assembly, to assume the office of the President under Article 146, pending a new presidential election within 60 days.

WE, THE CITIZENS OF KENYA and Everywhere, affix our signatures to this motion as a testament to our commitment to Justice, Accountability, and the Rule of Law. We stand united in defence of our Constitution and the future of our nation, demanding the immediate removal of President William Samoei Ruto from office and his prosecution locally and internationally for all alleged civil and criminal offenses.

Signed, 
	
      Signature                
…………………………………………………………………

Concerned Citizens everywhere.




This motion is grounded in the Constitution of Kenya (2010), particularly Article 145, which outlines the impeachment process, Chapter Four, which guarantees fundamental rights and the Geneva Conventions.
For Country.
